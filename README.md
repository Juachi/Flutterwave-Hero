•	Made a website for a business page titled RAAR that deals in handmade footwear. 
•	Created a payment page for your business to demo a payment process for your website using the ravepay API which was hosted with an apache server on the cloud (AWS).
•	The html is embedded in your php file which contains the php standard API for rave.
•	When a customer selects an item, he/she is taken to the payment payment page and if satisfied with the price and item, clicks on the 'Proceed' button which displays a place for the customers email. 
•	The customer inputs his/her email and is redirected to the rave payment platform where his/her account/ payment details are entered and the payment is processed.
•	A mail is sent to the customer and the merchant, whose dashboard is subsequently updated.
